TODO

Allow class to specify which element provides the slide title (possibly hidden)
Additional trigger options:
- hover zone at edge of slides
- keypress to open/close menu (probably 'm' by default), and up/down/enter to select slide
- via links in the slides, at least for demo purposes
Add menu panel for changing options, for both reveal (eg autoSlide, loop, show/hide controls, ...) and menu (eg change side, effect, ...)
